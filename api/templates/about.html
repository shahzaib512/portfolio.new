<h1 class="text-secondary" align="">About Me</h1>
<p>
  Are you eager to hear a
  <strong class="bg-dark rounded">story of transformation?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Allow me to introduce myself - I'm commonly known as
  <strong class="bg-dark rounded">"Danny"</strong>, an aspiring Python
  Developer. However, my journey to this career has been anything but ordinary.
</p>

<p>
  For over a decade, I worked as an Accountant. But as time went by, I became
  increasingly captivated by the dynamic and inventive realm of software
  development.
</p>
<p>
  I unearthed a passion for problem-solving, logical thinking, and the
  adaptability of Python as a programming language. Through Python, I found the
  chance to contribute to projects that directly impact people's lives, and I
  realized that this was my
  <strong class="bg-dark rounded">true calling.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  So, even in my early 30s, I bravely chose to take a leap of faith and
  transition into a new career as a Python Developer. I must say, it was one of
  the best decisions I've ever made.
</p>
<p>
  Now, I'm on a mission to create solutions that make a difference, utilizing my
  skills and expertise in Finance and Python.
